Class Definition
You have defined a base class Bird that has multiple methods representing behaviors common to all birds:

swim(): Prints that the bird is swimming.
fly(): Prints that the bird is flying.
eat(): Prints that the bird is eating.
sleep(): Prints that the bird is sleeping.
make_sound(): Prints that the bird is making a sound.
flap_wing(): Prints that the bird is flapping its wings.
The __class__.__name__.lower() construct is used to dynamically get the class name of the instance in lowercase, allowing the print statements to be accurate for each specific bird type.

Inheritance
You then define three classes that inherit from Bird:

Duck(Bird): Inherits all methods from Bird.
Crow(Bird): Inherits all methods from Bird.
Mallard(Duck): Inherits all methods from Duck (and transitively from Bird).
Since Duck and Crow don't have any additional methods or properties, they just inherit all behaviors of the Bird class. Similarly, Mallard inherits from Duck, which means it also gets all methods from the Bird class.

Instantiation and Testing
You create instances of each class and test their behaviors:

python
Copy code
duck = Duck()
crow = Crow()
mallard = Mallard()

duck.swim()    # Output: The duck is swimming
duck.fly()     # Output: The duck is flying

crow.swim()    # Output: The crow is swimming
crow.fly()     # Output: The crow is flying

mallard.swim() # Output: The mallard is swimming
mallard.fly()  # Output: The mallard is flying

mallard.flap_wing() # Output: The mallard is flapping its wings
Adding a New Behavior
You import the classes from a module ( birds_v1.py) and create a list of bird instances. Then, you iterate over this list and call their behaviors.

python
Copy code
from birds_v1 import Duck, Crow, Mallard

birds = [Duck(), Crow(), Mallard()]

for bird in birds:
    bird.fly()
    bird.swim()
    bird.eat()
    # Add a new behavior of the bird below 
    bird.flap_wing() # Uncomment this line to observe the new behavior
Observations
When you run the script and include the bird.flap_wing() call, you will observe that:

Each bird will print that it is flying.
Each bird will print that it is swimming.
Each bird will print that it is eating.
Each bird will print that it is flapping its wings.
This demonstrates that all these methods are correctly inherited and executed for each instance of Duck, Crow, and Mallard.
