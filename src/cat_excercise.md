1. Accessing dictionary elements using keys:
   You can access specific values of a dictionary by providing their
corresponding keys. For instance, to print the breed of cat1, you would do
this:

   ```python
   print(cat1["breed"])
   ```

2. Looping through dictionaries:
   You can iterate over each key-value pair in a dictionary using a `for`
loop. This is useful when you want to perform an action on every element
in the dictionary. Here's an example:

   ```python
   for cat in (cat1, cat2, cat3):
       print("Name:", cat["name"])
       print("Breed:", cat["breed"])
       print("\n")
   ```

3. Dict Comprehension:
   Dict comprehension is a concise way to create new dictionaries based on
existing ones, where you can filter and transform data as you go along.
Here's an example:

   ```python
   cats_dict = {cat["name"]: cat for cat in (cat1, cat2, cat3)}
   print(cats_dict)
   ```

4. Sorting dictionaries:
   You can sort the key-value pairs of a dictionary based on specific keys
using the `sorted()` function and then converting it into a list. Here's
an example:

   ```python
   cat_list = sorted(cat1.items(), key=lambda kv: kv[1]["age"])
   for name, details in cat_list:
       print("Name:", name)
       print("Age:", details["age"], "\n")
   ```

5. Filtering dictionaries:
   You can filter the elements of a dictionary based on specific
conditions using list comprehension and dictionary comprehension. Here's
an example:

   ```python
   cats_dict = {cat["name"]: cat for cat in (cat1, cat2)}
   orange_cats = {cat: cat["color"] for cat in cats_dict if "Orange" in
cat["color"]}
   print(orange_cats)
   ```
