Exercise 1: Introduction to the Python Interpreter
Objective: Familiarize yourself with starting the Python environment.

Opening the Terminal: Launch your computer's terminal application. This could be Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS, or any other terminal emulator available on Linux distributions.
Starting the Python Interpreter: Type python or python3 in the terminal and press Enter. You'll notice a change in the command line prompt, indicating that you're now within the Python environment. It will display >>>, signaling that Python is ready to execute commands.
Exercise 2: Performing Basic Arithmetic
Objective: Learn how to perform arithmetic operations in Python.

Simple Calculations: Execute basic mathematical operations such as addition (2 + 3), subtraction (5 - 2), multiplication (3 * 4), and division (10 / 2).
Exploring Additional Operations: Discover more complex operations like exponentiation (2 ** 3), modulus (10 % 3), and floor division (10 // 3).
Exercise 3: Utilizing Python's Help System
Objective: Understand how to access documentation and help information within Python.

Accessing the Help System: Simply type help() and press Enter. This action opens the built-in help system, providing access to Python's extensive documentation.
Exploring Built-in Functions: To learn about specific functions, such as print or len, type help(function_name) (e.g., help(print)). This will display detailed information about the function's usage and parameters.
Exiting the Help System: Return to the Python prompt by typing quit() and pressing Enter.
Exercise 4: Working with Variables and Data Types
Objective: Learn how to declare variables and understand their data types.

Creating and Assigning Variables: Assign values to variables using the equals sign (=). For example, a = 5 assigns the integer 5 to the variable a. Similarly, assign a string to name = 'Alice' and a list to numbers = [1, 2, 3].
Checking Data Types: Use the type() function to determine the data type of a variable. For instance, type(a) will return <class 'int'> for the variable a.
Exercise 5: Manipulating Strings
Objective: Get comfortable with string manipulation techniques in Python.

Basic String Operations: Concatenate strings using the plus operator ('Hello, ' + 'World!') and repeat strings ('Hello! ' * 3).
Using String Methods: Convert strings to uppercase with .upper(), replace substrings with .replace(old, new), and split strings into lists with .split().
Exercise 6: Understanding Lists and Indexing
Objective: Learn how to create and manipulate lists in Python.

Creating and Accessing Lists: Initialize a list with fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'] and access elements using indexing (e.g., fruits[0] for the first element).
List Methods: Append items with .append(item), remove items with .remove(item), and sort lists with .sort().
Exercise 7: Working with Dictionaries
Objective: Understand how dictionaries work in Python.

Creating and Accessing Dictionaries: Define a dictionary with person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25} and access values using keys (e.g., person['name']).
Dictionary Methods: Add new entries with [key] = value, remove entries with del [key], and retrieve keys or values with .keys() or .values().
Exercise 8: Implementing Control Flow
Objective: Learn how to control program flow with conditional statements and loops.

If Statements: Write conditions to execute code blocks based on whether they're true or false. Example: if x > 5: print('x is greater than 5').
Loops: Use for and while loops to repeatedly execute code. Example for loop: for i in range(5): print(i), and a while loop: i = 0; while i < 5: print(i); i += 1.
Exercise 9: Defining and Using Functions
Objective: Understand how to define custom functions and utilize built-in functions.

Defining and Calling Functions: Create a simple function with def greet(name): return f'Hello, {name}!' and call it with greet('Alice').
Built-in Functions: Explore functions like len() for getting the length of a list and sum() for calculating the sum of a list's elements.
Exercise 10: Importing and Using Modules
Objective: Learn how to extend Python's capabilities by importing external modules.

Importing Modules: Use import math to bring in the math module, allowing you to use mathematical functions like math.sqrt(16).
Module Documentation and Function Usage: Access module documentation with help(math) and use specific functions like math.factorial(5).
